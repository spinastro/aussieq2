# aussieq2
**aussieq2** calculate stellar ages and masses starting from the stellar parameters (temperature, gravity, and V magnitude) and a grid of isochrones. 

This is an example of the age probability distribution calculated for HIP 10175. The star has a most probable age of ~3.5 Gyr.

It also creates HR diagrams overplotting a det of isochrones and the stellar parameters (see this example: [HRD_plots.ipynb](https://github.com/spinastro/aussieq2/blob/master/HRD_plots.ipynb)).
